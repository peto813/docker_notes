Introduction
Itâ€™s time to begin building an app the Docker way. We start at the bottom of the hierarchy of such app, a container, which this page covers. Above this level is a service, which defines how containers behave in production, covered in Part 3. Finally, at the top level is the stack, defining the interactions of all the services, covered in Part 5.
